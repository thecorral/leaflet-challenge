# leaflet-challenge

The US Geological Survey (USGS) collects and analyzes scientific data on natural hazards, ecosystems, environment, and climate change. They require a new visualization tool for their earthquake data. The challenge is to develop a way to visualize the data to educate the public and other government organizations. The dataset is retrieved for the past two weeks using variables for today's date and the date two weeks prior. Using Leaflet, a map is created that plots all the earthquakes based on their longitude and latitude. Data markers reflect the magnitude and depth of the earthquake, with larger and darker markers indicating higher magnitude and depth, respectively. Popups provide additional information when the markers are clicked, and a legend illustrates the color scale by depth.
